Why
------

I often meet people who want to get started in infosec but haven't a clue where to start. Having transitioned from something totally unrelated myself, I've made a little list of things I found handy. The astute among you will note there is a bit of bias for pentesting type topics, good job. One thing that is probably missing from this list - Windows domains. Love or hate Windows if you work in info sec most likely your job is going to involve Windows domains; go research more about it, or don't - I'm not your boss.

If you're in the UK and serious about having a career in info sec you need to be doing the [UK Cyber Security Challenge](https://www.cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/). These courses, along with a load of trial and error, taught me enough to get through to the final stages and from that a career in info sec. In all honesty; you'll probably struggle at the start, don't give up - just go learn more stuff.

### Groundwork

#### CS50
_start here_
[Link](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

By far the best, most structured, well supported and useful MOOC I've taken. If you've already taken a CS related degree then this may be a little basic - It's aimed at first year undergrads (first year of university). For everyone else, I couldn't recommend it enough.

##### Key Points
..* Basics of C programming
..* Basics of understanding and implementing algorithms 
..* Intro to web technologies and development 

#### Networking
_How does I internet_
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmdYg02XJt6QRQfYjyQcMPfS3mrSnFbRC)

You really don't need to be a network architect however knowing your TCP from your ICMP is going to help. There are a million CCNA/CCENT courses out there this 84 video one from Andrew Crouthamel worked great for me. You can purchase the videos and study notes if you want but the entire set of videos are on youtube. You could also probably go on a do the CCENT/CCNA exam if you like bits of paper.

##### Key Points
..* How networks work
..* Routing
..* Common protocols

### Security Focus
After the basics you can get started with more security focused topics, if you already have a background in IT/networking/development you can probably start here.

#### FSU: Offensive Computer Security
_Hacking 101_
[Link](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~redwood/OffensiveComputerSecurity/)

This will give you a little overview of most of the technical aspects of info sec. Not every topic is covered in tedious detail but as much as you might want to be a serious specialist having a broad knowledge base is going to help you get you're foot in the door.

##### Key Points
..* Web app security
..* Network security
..* Reverse engineering / exploit dev
..* Much more..

#### Metasploitable
_Oh yeah, that's like metasploit and stuff_
[Link](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/)

You're probably raring to get your hands into popping boxes and unleashing amazing SQL injection attacks now is the time! (kinda). This course along with the vulnerable VM is about more than just using everyone's favourite framework it covers topics from across multiple security domains, all from withing the comforts of kali linux.

##### Key Points
..* Using kali and metasploit
..* Network security
..* Web Security
..* Pentesting process

#### Web Application Hackers Handbook
_Wait, you never said there would be reading..._
[Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B005LVQA9S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

Ok, so not only is reading; it also isn't free. That said there is a reason this is on the list - it's pretty much the best resource for learning web application security. I didn't actually read this book until _after_ I'd started in info sec and I wish I'd read it before. The book is a cross between web application security and an experts guide to the Burp Suite (it's written by the guy that dev'd it - go figure). 

**NB**: Write your name in the front of this as it'll probably end up on your desk and end up going walking...

##### Key Points
..* Using burp - your number one web app testing tool
..* In-depth discussion of web application vulnerabilities
..* Web application testing methodology
..* Excellent reference material for future testing 

### Low-level
I personally have a great love for low-level computing, reverse engineering and, exploits hence the topics here are focused toward these. I think everyone in info sec should learn the basics of x86 assembly as in the end, pretty much everything we do is going to involve around computers.

#### x86 Assembly - Open Security Training (OST)
_0x90 0x90 0x90 0x90_
[Link](http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html)

Some people don't get on with the open security training course - I'll admit the videos aren't exactly 4K. That said, if you can get passed that all the course on OST are amazingly high quality, well taught and pretty much equivalent to security courses costing thousands. As of the time of writing I;m also going through the [intermediate version](http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntermediateX86.html) which is also excellent. 

##### Key Points
..* Core understnading of x86 assembly
..* Using the GDB debuger
..* First steps in exploit deb 

#### Exploits 1 & 2 - Open Security Training (OST)
[Link 1](http://opensecuritytraining.info/Exploits1.html)
[Link 2](http://opensecuritytraining.info/Exploits2.html)

If you love the idea of smashing stacks and spraying heaps these are the courses for you. Again totally free and self-paced, in person courses from large providers are hella expensive and not so easy to do in your lunch breaks. For those of you unfamiliar with numbers, do Exploits 1 (Linux focused) then Exploits 2 (Windows focused). 

##### Key Points Exploits 1 - Linux based
..* Refresh your x86
..* More GDB
..* Basics of stack/heap exploits
..* Writing your own shellcode
..* Defeating some anti-exploitation mitigation

##### Key Points Exploits 2 - Windows based
..* Exploitation in the Windows environments
..* Using WinDBG
..* Windows exploits
..* Defeating modern anti-exploitation mechanisms (DEP, SEH, ALSR)
..* The exploit development process
